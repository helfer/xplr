## 1: Did any of your answers to Milestone 1 change?
The only thing we really changed is that we decided to go with Meteor instead of Django, because we have a client-side heavy application for which we don't need all the logic on the server that Django provides. In addition, Meteor is very simple to deploy, saving us time.

## 2:   Which features are implemented. To what extent are they complete?
* Split screen for using street view & map: This is essentially our site, without it, we have nothing.
* Letting the user guess and then reveal the real location: The game aspect is central to our page.
* Keeping track of user's guesses: Login is required to keep track of guesses.


## 3:    Are there any features you wanted to include in your MVP from Milestone 1 that are not complete?
We were conservative when defining our MVP. All the MVPs features have been implemented, but they need more work to make the game more compelling and different from existing sites.

## 4:    What additional features do you wish to implement?
* Our own login and signup modals (The ones of Meteor aren't very pretty).
* A more flexible, more compelling UI. The current one works, but is not nice.
* An explanation/introduction page
* Buttons to share on fb, twitter.
* A scoring system and a way to play with/against friends.
* If all goes well, we'd like to extend the game to include Boston and Somerville.

## 5:    What technologies are you using for the back-end? Include any frameworks if relevant.
We are using Meteor and all the stuff that comes almost for free along with it, such as node.js and underscore

## 6:    What technologies are you using for the front-end?
We are using Meteor, and with it also handlebars, jQuery and underscore. We use 3rd party APIs of Google and mapbox for the street view images and the map.
 
## 7:    What is the main browser you are targeting?
We tested on Firefox and Chrome.

## 8:    What implementation unknown / risks are you still facing?
The biggest risk we see right now is that we don't manage to make the game compelling enough, either through a great user interface or by adding a social component (or both).
